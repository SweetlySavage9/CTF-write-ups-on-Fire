# Solution

While inspecting the code, I began by pressing the 'Say Hello' button, which triggered a popup that hinted the code was located in another file. 🔍

There were two files: style.css and script.jss. 🗂️
The flag was hidden in both files, and I had to join them together to reveal the complete flag. 🧩💡
