# Problem

Do you know how to use the web inspector?
Start searching here to find the flag

# Solution

I took my first step by inspecting the index.html source page but didn’t find anything useful there. 🔍

Next, I realized there were **two more HTML pages: About and Contact**.

When I clicked on the About page, I noticed a **hint saying there might be something hidden there**.
🧐 After a closer look, I found a **funky code**! 😏

I copied this code and fed it into **CyberChef**. This tool has a lot of functionalities in one place, and after trying out a few options, I decoded it from Base64 and finally got the flag! 🎉🚩
