# Problem

The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at?

## Hint

Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for {{name}}'s?

# Solution

Initially inspecting the source code of the website.

I couldn't find anything there, so I decided to try logging in as **joe**.

After inspect I've gone the **application section** and then checked for **cookies**. 

Below image you can see I used **password** as username and password. You can use any credentials like I did password

Now I've changed the value of admin value to **True**. This grants you admin privileges on the site.

After setting the value **True** just reload the page to get the flag!!!!!!!!!!!!
