# Problem
Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?

# Hint
1. A bookmarklet is a bookmark that runs JavaScript instead of loading a webpage.
2. What happens when you click a bookmarklet?
3. Web browsers have other ways to run JavaScript too.

# Solution

This challenge involved some basic JavaScript. 

Answering the hints helped me solve this challenge.

1. The challenge was related to JavaScript. 💻
2. I clicked on the bookmarklet, which copied the code. 📋
3. I opened the Console tab in Developer Tools. 🛠️
   
**Problem**: The browser didn’t allow me to paste the code, and I got an error. ❌

**Fix**: I typed "allow pasting" in the console and hit Enter. This allowed me to paste the code and run it. ✅
