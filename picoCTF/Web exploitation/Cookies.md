# Problem

Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one.

# Solution

This is the easiest CTF. The name itself gives a hint to look for the flag in cookies 🍪.

So, navigate to the Inspect tool, followed by the Application tab, and find the cookies area. There, I tried to change the values of the cookies.

That was the craziest part! 😂 I even tried -2, which gave me an error. I tried all the numbers—oops, that was crazy! 😅 But at last, I got it! 🎉
