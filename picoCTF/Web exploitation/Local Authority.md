I attempted to log in using the **username and password as admin**, but I got an error saying "Login failed" ❌. 
This triggered the appearance of two files: login.php and secure.js.

Inspecting the login.php file didn’t reveal much — it just contained code for accepting **alphanumeric characters** in the password 🔍.

However, when I examined the secure.js file, it provided the **credentials** I needed 🗝️.

Enter the credentials to login and further get the flag
